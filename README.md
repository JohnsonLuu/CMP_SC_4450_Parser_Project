# 4450 Parser Project

In this project, our team will be implementing a parser for the Python language by using Backus-Naur Forms (BNFs) in ANTLR. The team will work together to complete sprints, or deliverables, by the due date. For each of these sprints, the team will meet or communicate though discord to assign each member a task to complete by the end of the sprint. After completing each sprint, the team's project should be able to parse Python code for each of the required tasks.
